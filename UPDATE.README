To update:
create backup snapshot

git pull git://github.com/fastlane/boarding
resolve conflicts
git add/commit/push # might need env GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY=true especially on staging server
bundle install # to get new required gems

Might need to:
sudo gem update fastlane # although it's probably handled by bundle install

Don't forget to restart apache:
apachectl restart
